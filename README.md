# Food-Panda
Food Panda is a 2D singleplayer side-scroller game developed in Java. The player controls Naruto, a panda on a quest to reach the Babylon Temple and collect ramen while avoiding traps and allergic food placed by the antagonist, Kirin the dragon. 
The game features two levels with increasing difficulty, player movement using WASD keys, collision detection, and a scoring system. Collecting chocolate increases points and energy, while hitting obstacles or allergic food decreases them.
